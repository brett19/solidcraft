Updates: WR-723

#### WR-723 (update, 2026-11-14). `planar_section_face_tolerance` is removed; a face's section is traced to the face's tolerance

`face_planar_section_curves` (`topology/brep/planar_section.rs`), the per-face step of `create_planar_section_curves`,
always passes the face's tolerance on as the approximation tolerance when none is given. The opt-in described in the
original record no longer exists. Removed: the field, SolidCraft's preset line, its entry in the
`issue_2656_blend_regressions.rs` flag list, the flag-off branch, and the test setting in
`wr698_gn_round_is_its_definition.rs`.

- **Defaults:** SolidCraft's preset had the flag on, so the app's results don't change. `Kernel::default()` changes.
- **Goldens:** 15 `topology.brep_planar_section` rows move: cone_slant, nurb_fillet_section, the three fillet_box_y98
  cases and faces_fillet_box_y98, and gen0015/0025/0038/0056/0070/0071/0073/0074/0089/0093. In every row the section
  curves keep their count, type and topology; only the traced points move. Every section curve of the 15 rows (85
  curves) is proved within its face's 1e-5 tolerance of the plane (the hull of its control points) and of a face's
  surface (`nurbs::certificate::span_bound`), rounding counted:
  `topology_brep_planar_section::section_certificate`. With the size default, 27 of those curves in 8 rows are not
  proved; sampled, they lay up to 1.6e-2 off. No other row of any unit moves.
- **Tests:** `a_plane_section_of_a_round_is_within_its_tolerance` runs on the default kernel; the certificate
  above is new.
